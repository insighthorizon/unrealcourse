How much planning should we do?

Define the motional problem the game solves
       I want a mental challenge
       I want to feel smart / prove myself
       I miss word puzzles
       I want to challenge (feel superior to) someone'
       Etc

Chose concept, rules & requirements
      This is a "guess the isogram" game
      An isogram is word with no repeating letters
      The user has a limited number of guesses
      After each guess the computer outputs the number of bulls and cows
      (bull = ritght letter on right place, cow = right letter on wrong place)

      Requirements: -inputs: text (isogram guess)
      		    -outputs: text(number of bulls, cows, game result, instructions)
		    -tasks of the user - writting guesses attemting to guess the isogram
		    -performance limits worth mentioning? - no, maybe memory size of vocabulary
		    -what assets (art,sound, story): isogram vocabulary
		    -code to help the player make a valid guess (is isogram?, lowecase/upercase, valid length)
		    -code to check the number of bulls and cows in the guess
		    -code to keep track of valid guesses
		    -user selectable word length, difficulty
		    -providing a time limit
		    -checking the users guess
		    -a hint system - spend a trun for a hint

Copy as much as possible into the code!
